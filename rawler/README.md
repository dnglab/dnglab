# Rawler
Digital camera raw format library

## What is Rawler?
Rawler parses raw file formats and provides access to the pixels
and all metadata.

## Why is it named rawler?
It's a (c)rawler, just for raw file structures.

## Why another raw library?

 * There are libraries dealing with metadata (exiv2) and for pixels (rawspeed, libraw),
   but not for both. Each library ships their own file structure parsers.
 * rawloader, which is basically the fundament of this library, is a pretty good library,
   but lacks of support for metadata.
 * For fun.

# How to Contribute RAW Samples

New raw image formats or cameras can only be integrated when a full set of raw
sample files exists. You can help to speed up support for your new camera if
you contribute a full set of samples.

Please see the specific manufacturer section for further instructions.

## Important Notes

For every sample set, the scene must be properly exposed during daylight. The
ideal scene is a landscape where many colors are visible, like a blue sky with
white clouds, green grass and flowers/trees. Don't capture people, cars or any
other private property.

**No color checker cards, please. They won't work well for visual checks.**

The sample set must be licensed under CC-0 license. If you submit a sample set,
you explicitly state that you are the copyright owner of the images.

**Please don't submit files with names like IMG_0001.CR2. Always give your files a good name like CANON_5DMK3_ISO_100_SRAW.CR2.**

## How to Upload

As the samples sets are usually very big, please use an upload service like
[wetransfer.com]. After uploading as a ZIP file, please raise an issue on our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab/issues). and provide the
download link.

## Instructions

### Canon (CR3)

Before you do the shots, please go to the
[camera's menu](https://cam.start.canon/en/C006/manual/html/UG-09_Set-up_0300.html)
and set copyright to: "CC-0", so we can use the sample set in all raw sample
databases.

New Canon cameras (>=2019) may have some special capture modes. If your camera
supports different shutter modes (mechanical, electrical), please duplicate the
core set and take one with mechanical, another one with electrical shutter (the
latter uses reduced bit depth).

The core set must consists of these shoots:

* **RAW** mode: ISO 100, 800, MAX-ISO (depends on your camera, often denotes by
  H or H1/H2)
* **CRAW** mode: ISO 100, 800, MAX-ISO (depends on your camera, often denotes
  by H or H1/H2)

If your camera supports *burst mode*:

* **Burst** mode: ISO 100 with 3-5 frames maximum (keep the size small)

If your camera supports *dual pixel mode*:

* **Dual Pixel** mode: ISO 100, one shot with *RAW*, another with *CRAW*
  compression

If your camera supports *HEIF* format:

* **HEIF** mode: ISO 100

### Olympus/OM Digial Solutions (ORF)

The core set must consists of these shoots:

* ISO 100

If your camera supports high resolutions modes:

* ISO 100 with high resolution mode (handheld, tripod, ...)

### Fujifilm

The core set must consists of these shoots (if supported):

* **uncompressed** mode: ISO 100
* **lossless compressed** mode: ISO 100
* **lossy compressed** mode: ISO 100

## Panasonic

The core set must consists of these shoots (if supported):

* ISO 100 with all possible crops (1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9)

* **PEF** mode: ISO 100

If your camera supports high resolution / pxiel shift modes:

* PEF and DNG with high resolution mode

### Nikon and Sony (NEF/ARW)

The core set must consists of all the combinations of compression and bitness
settings, plus all the raw sizes, that is:

* 12bit-compressed
* 12bit-uncompressed
* 12bit-lossless-compressed
* 14bit-compressed
* 14bit-uncompressed
* 14bit-lossless-compressed
* L (large), M (medium), S (small) formats
* APS-C S35 mode
